- [Touch My Body](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=8gQA4-1G5tc)
| Touch my body, put me on the floor
| Wrestle me around, play with me some more
| Touch my body, throw me on the bed
| I just wanna make you feel like you never did
| Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
| All around your waist, just a little taste
| Touch my body, know you like my curves
| Come on and give me what I deserve
| And touch my body
|
| Boy, you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
| I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
| I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
| And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea
