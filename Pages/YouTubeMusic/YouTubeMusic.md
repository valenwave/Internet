## Downloads

As a subscriber, I get the option to download music (great for saving on mobile data and long drives). Looks like when I go thorugh downloaded music, I can filter by Playlists, Podcasts, Songs, and Albums. So, if I want some kind of greatest hits from random artists, I'll have to play a playlist.

## Playlists

YouTube music is terriable when it comes to playlists. One of the reasons for this is that the playlists here bleeds into YouTube and vice-versa. So, I'm making some custom playlsits here.
